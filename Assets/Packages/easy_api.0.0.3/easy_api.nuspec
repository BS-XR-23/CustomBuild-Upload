    <description>EasyAPI: Simplified REST API Calls for Unity
Easily integrate RESTful APIs into your Unity projects with EasyAPI, a lightweight, async-friendly package designed to streamline HTTP requests. Whether you're interacting with third-party services or building your own backend, EasyAPI makes sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests a breeze, all while handling authentication headers, serialization, and error handling seamlessly.

Key Features:
*Simplified API interactions using UniTask for asynchronous programming.
*Easily send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with automatic JSON serialization.
*Support for common authentication schemes like Bearer and Basic token.
*Built-in success and failure callbacks to handle responses efficiently.
*Lightweight and easy-to-use, with minimal setup required.

Whether you're developing a game, an app, or any Unity-based project that requires external data, EasyAPI allows you to connect to APIs in just a few lines of code—empowering you to focus on building great experiences instead of dealing with complex HTTP logic.</description>
